    <h1>About JuteBag</h1>
      <p class="lead">
      JuteBag is a shopping list application. Developed as a toy project, I intend to explore as many technologies as possible
      while at the same time creating some useful application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being a toy project, it aims for usability as well. However, it is not intended for production yet, that is,
        data loss may occur at any time, especially due to incompatible updates. That's not a bug, just expected behaviour.
